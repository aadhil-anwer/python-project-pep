N-Queens Visualizer Using Python and Tkinter
Introduction
This project provides a visual representation of the classic N-Queens problem using Python and Tkinter. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This implementation uses a backtracking algorithm to find all possible solutions and visualizes the process in real-time.

Features
Interactive Visualization: Watch the backtracking algorithm in action as it attempts to place the queens.
Customizable Board Size: Enter the desired number of queens to see the corresponding board size.
Real-Time Updates: The board updates in real-time to show the algorithm's progress.
Statistics: Display the number of solutions found, iterations performed, and the time taken to solve the problem.
Graphical Interface: Utilizes Tkinter for the GUI and PIL for image handling to replace text-based queens with images.

Enter the number of queens when prompted.
Project Structure
main.py: The main script to run the N-Queens visualizer.
README.md: Project documentation and instructions.
queen.png: Image file used to represent the queens on the board (ensure this image is in the same directory as the script).
How It Works
Backtracking Algorithm: The core logic uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore all possible positions for the queens.
Tkinter for GUI: The Tkinter library is used to create the graphical user interface, providing a visual representation of the board.
PIL for Images: The Python Imaging Library (PIL) is used to load and display images in place of text-based queens.
